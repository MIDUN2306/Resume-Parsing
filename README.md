**Project Title:** **Resume Parsing and matching**

**Description:**

This Python web application, built using Streamlit, is designed to analyze user-uploaded resumes, provide insights, and offer tailored recommendations for career paths, skills, and courses. It leverages techniques like natural language processing and machine learning to extract relevant information from resumes and generate personalized suggestions.

**Key Features:**

- **Resume Analysis:** Extracts information such as name, email, skills, experience, and education from uploaded resumes.
- **Skill Recommendation:** Suggests relevant skills based on the analyzed resume content.
- **Career Path Recommendation:** Predicts potential career paths based on skills and experience.
- **Course Recommendations:** Offers curated course suggestions aligned with the recommended career paths.
- **Resume Score:** Provides a score based on resume quality and completeness.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Allows users to provide feedback on the analysis and recommendations.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- PyPDF2 (or other PDF parsing library)
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Other libraries as specified in the code (e.g., `pymysql` for database connection, `plotly` for visualizations)

**Installation:**

1. Create a new Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas pyresparser nltk pymysql plotly
   ```
4. Install any additional libraries mentioned in the code.

**Usage:**

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Access the web app in your browser.
3. Upload your resume in PDF format.
4. The application will analyze your resume and provide recommendations.

**Database Setup:**

Ensure you have a MySQL database set up and configure the connection details in the code. Create the necessary tables for user data and feedback.

**Customization:**

- Modify the database connection details in the code.
- Adjust the recommendation logic and skill sets as needed.
- Customize the user interface and styling using Streamlit's features.
